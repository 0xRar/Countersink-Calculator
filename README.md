## What is Countersink:
A countersink is a cutting tool, which cuts a conical hole into an object. The most popular
application for countersinks is to de-bur an existing hole to allow a bolt or screw to sit
flush against the workpiece surface. Countersinks can also be a convenient tool for removing
burs left over from drilling or tapping applications.
